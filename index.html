        Even though we are looking for efficient and reliable sources of renewable energy, the entire world 
        is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. However, onshore and certain offshore oil fields are facing  
        depletion at rapid rates, the search for more reserves is now towards harder to reach locations, such 
        as in deeper seas. However extracting fossil fuels from such reserves poses great challenges. The 
        biggest oil spill accident due to the explosion of Deepwater Horizon, an offshore oil platform in the 
        Gulf of Mexico, is a grim example of the risky challenges ahead. This incident helped spark the 
        development of better drilling systems, smarter inspection systems and more efficient safety control     
        systems. The automation of the offshore oil and gas industry minimises the hazards and risks that   
        Deepwater Horizon was exposed to. Remotely operated vehicles (ROV’s) and unmanned drilling
        platforms is the gold standard in the offshore industry today.

        The demand for energy is constantly increasing and with renewable energy sources not efficient 
		enough to significantly meet the energy demand we are still heavily reliant on our fossil fuels. 
		Around 80% of our energy demands are met by fossil fuels (Bai, Y. and Bai, Q., 2018). However now 	
		as the onshore and shallow water offshore oil fields are reaching depletion, deepwater oil fields are 
		starting to take over. In 2010 shallow water oil fields (<400 m) contributed 19 mb/d (million barrels 
		per day) which is around 80% of total offshore output however, shallow water oil fields have 
		increased in production quite slowly since 1960 where the production was closer to 1 mb/d. On the 
		other hand, deepwater (>400m) productions has increased from 1.5 mb/d by 2000 to 4 mb/d in 
		2009 (Sandrea, R. & Sandrea, I. 2010). This increase shows that the offshore industry is moving away 
		from shallow water to deepwater drilling.

		A main problem of deepwater drilling has been that it’s more dangerous than shallow water and one 
		of the most known examples of this is the accident of Deep Horizon (BP) oil spill in the Gulf of 
		Mexico. This was the largest oil spill in the world, killing 11 crew members on the drilling rig and 
		affecting the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen and destroying much of the marine life at the 
		time. It was estimated that over 6 million barrels of crude oil were spilled in the Gulf and even after 
		clean-up efforts, effects of this spill will be felt for decades (Griggs, J.W., 2011; Valentine, M.M. and 
		Benfield, M.C., 2013). The cause of the incidents was due to ignored warning signals and systematic 
		of proper risk assessment and management (Stilwell, K., 2013). This accident led to many discussions 
		between governments, environmentalists and oil and gas companies about the future of drilling 
		deepwater reservoirs and how to improve the safety measures for future projects. The surveying 
		and drilling of deepwater oil and gas reservoirs are extremely difficult as it takes place at over 400 
		meters in a high-pressure environment. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico became so problematic 
		due to the fact the leak happened at the depth of 1511 meters, too deep for any technology 
		available to control the spill at the time of the leak (Shukla, A. and Karki, H., 2016). After several oil 	
		spills occurred in Europe as well, the European Commission has already funded research projects 
		developing innovative robotic technologies for oil spill management (Psaraftis, H.N. and Ventikos, N.P., 2006).
