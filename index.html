        Even though we are looking for efficient and reliable sources of renewable energy, the entire world 
        is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. However, onshore and certain offshore oil fields are facing  
        depletion at rapid rates, the search for more reserves is now towards harder to reach locations, such 
        as in deeper seas. However extracting fossil fuels from such reserves poses great challenges. The 
        biggest oil spill accident due to the explosion of Deepwater Horizon, an offshore oil platform in the 
        Gulf of Mexico, is a grim example of the risky challenges ahead. This incident helped spark the 
        development of better drilling systems, smarter inspection systems and more efficient safety control     
        systems. The automation of the offshore oil and gas industry minimises the hazards and risks that   
        Deepwater Horizon was exposed to. Remotely operated vehicles (ROV’s) and unmanned drilling
        platforms is the gold standard in the offshore industry today.

        <pre>
        The demand for energy is constantly increasing and with renewable energy sources not efficient 
	enough to significantly meet the energy demand we are still heavily reliant on our fossil fuels. 
	Around 80% of our energy demands are met by fossil fuels (Bai, Y. and Bai, Q., 2018). However now 	
	as the onshore and shallow water offshore oil fields are reaching depletion, deepwater oil fields are 
	starting to take over. In 2010 shallow water oil fields (<400 m) contributed 19 mb/d (million barrels 
	per day) which is around 80% of total offshore output however, shallow water oil fields have 
	increased in production quite slowly since 1960 where the production was closer to 1 mb/d. On the 
	other hand, deepwater (>400m) productions has increased from 1.5 mb/d by 2000 to 4 mb/d in 
	2009 (Sandrea, R. & Sandrea, I. 2010). This increase shows that the offshore industry is moving away 
	from shallow water to deepwater drilling.

	A main problem of deepwater drilling has been that it’s more dangerous than shallow water and one 
	of the most known examples of this is the accident of Deep Horizon (BP) oil spill in the Gulf of 
	Mexico. This was the largest oil spill in the world, killing 11 crew members on the drilling rig and 
	affecting the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen and destroying much of the marine life at the 
	time. It was estimated that over 6 million barrels of crude oil were spilled in the Gulf and even after 
	clean-up efforts, effects of this spill will be felt for decades (Griggs, J.W., 2011; Valentine, M.M. and 
	Benfield, M.C., 2013). The cause of the incidents was due to ignored warning signals and systematic 
	of proper risk assessment and management (Stilwell, K., 2013). This accident led to many discussions 
	between governments, environmentalists and oil and gas companies about the future of drilling 
	deepwater reservoirs and how to improve the safety measures for future projects. The surveying 
	and drilling of deepwater oil and gas reservoirs are extremely difficult as it takes place at over 400 
	meters in a high-pressure environment. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico became so problematic 
	due to the fact the leak happened at the depth of 1511 meters, too deep for any technology 
	available to control the spill at the time of the leak (Shukla, A. and Karki, H., 2016). After several oil 	
	spills occurred in Europe as well, the European Commission has already funded research projects 
	developing innovative robotic technologies for oil spill management (Psaraftis, H.N. and Ventikos, N.P., 2006).

	Accidents like the Deepwater Horizon spillage united researchers and innovators across the globe to 
	start working on better safety measures and reduce the need of putting human lives at risk by 
	leaning towards automating certain procedures and relying more onto robotics rather than people.
        With the depletion of onshore and offshore shallow water reservers (<400m), the offshore industry 
        is looking more into the exploration and production of oil and gas in deeper waters (>400m) (Bai, Y. 
        and Bai, Q., 2018).  The new deep water fields are beyond rech for divers and with stricter 
        regulations to minimise catastrophic failures, the usage of robots, mainly ROV’s (Remotely Operated 
        Vechiles) and AUV’s (Autonomous Underwater Vechicles) has become compulsary at this type of 
        depth (Shukla, A. and Karki, H., 2016). The use of robots means that humans can remotly control and 
        monitor them so they don’t have to be on the oil rigs themselves but rather on support vessels close 
        by, making the industry safer for human lives. Another benefit is that robots are less likely to make 
        the mistakes and errors humans might do, making them more reliable.

        ROV’s are highly maneuverable remote controlled vehicles and is mainly used for deep sea 
        applications. They are controlled by a person on board a vessel close to the where the oil rig is and 
        the ROV is connected to the vessel by a set of cables (Chen, H., Stavinoha, S., Walker, M., Zhang, B. 
        and Fuhlbrigge, T., 2014). In shallow waters, divers were tasked with inspecting and maintaining 
        production platforms (oil rigs), however in deeper waters, divers not viable anymore due to the 
        crushing pressure of the depths. This is what pushed the oil and gas industry to accept the usage of 
        ROV’s to replace the divers in deep water drilling at a time that ROV’s were not the most profitable 
        option. However today ROV’s are economically viable and are the gold standard in offshore drilling. 
        ROV’s today are used extensively in the offshore industry for tasks such as underwater survey,
        inspection, repair, welding, cutting, object recovery, sample collection and many more (Shukla, A.   
        and Karki, H., 2016). AUV’s on the other hand, don’t need an operator and work autonomously and 
        therefore they are used for different purposes on the oil rig.

        While the depletion of oil and gas reservoirs onshore and in shallow water is alarming, the solution 
        can be found in deep water drilling. Even though deep-water drilling poses one the greatest 
        engineering challenges of all time, it’s undoubtedly the future of the oil and gas industry. However, 
        the only way deep-water drilling can keep expanding is by using robotic technology, in the future the 
        whole industry is going to be completely revamped and focused on the use of this technology. Oil 
        rigs will become completely unmanned, divers will no longer be hired as ROV’s and AUV’s take over 
        the underwater missions and tasks, and the risks of human and marine life as minimised as possible, 
        the oil and gas industry isn’t dying, it’s just changing.
